# number-system-converter
This a nummber system converter supporting using decimal point, a.k.a. fraction, and it can use up to hexadecimal. However, there are still two things can be improved:
<ol>
<li>In the last while loop, the program can halt because multiplication in a computer can distort greater and greater, so we may use the module "decimal" to improve this.</li>
<li>On solving the aforementioned problem, we may need to consider the input and output of a recurring decimal.</li>
</ol>
